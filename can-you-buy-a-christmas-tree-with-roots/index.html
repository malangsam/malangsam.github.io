<p>Most types of real Christmas trees take approximately seven years to reach maturity and for every tree that is harvested anywhere from one to three more seedlings are planted. These have large field-dug root balls bundled in burlap or other fabric. The needles are soft the color is deeply rich and the sharp slightly sweet scent of evergreen fills the air creating a happy holiday mood. These Xmas trees can be decorated and used inside the home for Christmas and then can be planted in the garden directly after the holidays. No you cant root a Christmas tree.</p>
