<p>Remove the burlap and any other coverings on the root ball. To propagate your Christmas tree get a branch shortly after you cut down your tree and no more than a few days later. Place the tree back into the cold sheltered area for a week or two so that the tree can re-enter dormancy if it has started to come out of dormancy while it was in the house. Use branches of a fresh-cut tree. The sacred Christmas Tree that everyone enjoys during Christmas does not need to parish but can continue life as a growing tree back in nature.</p>

<p>Roots cannot grow around the cut trunk of a Christmas tree because that part of the tree simply doesnt have the cells that make the new roots. A stem cutting from a shrub or tree can be used to start a new plant. Use branches of a fresh-cut tree. Also even if roots did grow there wouldnt be enough to support the tree above - the only way would be for the trunk to be cut back to about 6 and hope that new shoots would develop from that. After transplanting they become 6 footers in 5-8 years.</p>
