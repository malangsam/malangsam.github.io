<p>As we live central we didnt want something big and they had plenty of smaller great affordable trees. The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree has been an annual gift to the people of Britain from Norway as a token of gratitude for British support to Norway during the Second World WarThe first tree was cut down by Mons Urangsvåg in 1942 during a raid on the Norwegian island called Hisøy. The Christmas spirit is alive and well at the Jeromin household in Germany as the family is going into the record books for the most decorated trees in one place. Its nearly impossible to get a photo of the entire tree which is 40 feet tall from the ground floor so hop up to the second floor for a birds eye view. The trees take anywhere from six to eight years to mature from seedlings.</p>
