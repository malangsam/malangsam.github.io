Christmas time is coming through the air Trees and lights and presents meant to share A gift is almost anything Its the joy that love can bring Its the smile on faces everywhere Lets light up the windows after dark Build a funny snowman in the park And hear the children caroling Making magic as they sing All I want for. Merry New York Christmas Call on your Angels come down to the city Lets crowd around the big tree all you strangers you know me Bring your compassion bring your forgiveness Lord how we need it on this New York City Christmas Yeah Im sending you a Merry New York Christmas And a prayer for peace on earth its not too late.</p>
