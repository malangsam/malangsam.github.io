<p>It is one of the symbols of Christmas that stands out in this country as much as. Dramas depicting biblical themes began as part of the churchs worship. Because Christmas is all about Jesus decorating a tree presents the opportunity to extend Gods love and message of salvation to others. Adam and Eve ate the forbidden fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in the Garden of Eden and Jesus died on a tree to take away our sins. The Christmas tree is actually much older than Christianity only in the old days it wasnt called a Christmas tree obviously and people didnt usually put the whole tree in their homes.</p>
