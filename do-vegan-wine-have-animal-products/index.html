Given that wine is the product of grapes and yeast some may assume that all wines would be appropriate for vegans those who do not consume any kind of animal product but this isnt always the case. With the rise of veganism along with an increased desire for organic and biodynamic wines winemakers across the world are taking note and adopting a more natural approach.</p>

<p>This process is used to remove protein yeast cloudiness off flavors and colorings and other organic particles. In fact you might be surprised by the number of wines that are not vegan. If youre strict then there are other things to look for such as the glue which can sometimes contain ingredients derived from animal bone or connective tissue used for the label. Some people use bentonite which is a kind of clay and would make the wine vegetarian. The majority of people are unaware that wine although made from grapes may have been made using animal-derived products.</p>

<p>The thing to remember though is that those proteins dont remain in the wine. In fact you might be surprised by the number of wines that are not vegan. The Vegan Vine does not use any animal products in wine production. Some people use bentonite which is a kind of clay and would make the wine vegetarian. Normally we dont use animal-derived products in our wines but depending on the characteristics of a particular blend we may choose to use a fining agent or some other processing aid including egg whites gelatin or isinglass.</p>

<p>However manufacturers are fully aware that there are a significant number of vegans and vegetarians who prefer white vegan wine. If wines are left to develop completely naturally they will usually self-fine reducing the need to introduce animal products into the process. While the main ingredient in wine is a fruit and therefore vegan animal products are sometimes used during the winemaking process meaning the product itself is not vegan. If youre strict then there are other things to look for such as the glue which can sometimes contain ingredients derived from animal bone or connective tissue used for the label. Wineries will sometimes claim that their wine is vegan.</p>
