<p>There isnt a single way to eat vegan you can follow an unhealthy vegan diet or a healthy one. Yet vegans avoid honey just because its an animal product. Foods from plants are OK but foods from animals are off limits including common ingredients like eggs cheese milk and honey. Vegans dont eat animal products or animal-derived products including meat dairy products like milk cheese and butter or eggs. Veganism is the practice of abstaining from the use of animal products particularly in diet and an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.</p>
