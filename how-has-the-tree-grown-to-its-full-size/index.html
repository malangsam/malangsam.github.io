<p>Unique for its remarkable leaf coloring this small weeping tree has leaves that emerge in spring a vibrant shade of red-orange. It is often used for containers where it can be grown with a trunk and planted underneath with annual flowers or bulbs to. A potted Christmas tree will have been grown for at least a year in its container and so as it is a real Christmas tree what youre really buying is a temporary houseplant. The tree does reasonably well in dry neutral soils. The tree is rounded to cascading in shape and some summer watering is worthwhile in very hot locations.</p>
