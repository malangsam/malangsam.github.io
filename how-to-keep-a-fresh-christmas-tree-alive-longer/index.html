Daily your tree should drink one liter of water per 3cm 12in of the stem diameter reveals Christmas tree expert Mary Dimitrova from Fantastic Services. Its important to water your tree regularly and check the water levels of your Christmas tree daily to ensure your tree doesnt dry out. The cool air drafts that sneak in will help cool it down. Lowering the room temperature can be a good way to preserve the tree and keep its needles from drying out.</p>

<p>How to Keep Christmas Trees Alive Longer Based on Science One. We recommend watering at least once every 2 days. Cut a small amount around 3cm from the base of the trunk before you put the tree up this will ensure it. Then consider stringing your tree with LED lights instead of the hotter standard Christmas light bulbs. Even if it means refilling the stand every day tree hydration is the key to Christmas tree care.</p>
