<p>The only I didnt like was the way the company labeled the 75ft tree as warm lights unlit. You have to shape it at first like an other artificial tree. From beautiful forest scenes to on-trend grey tree wallpaper for walls find everything you need to bring your touch of the outdoors into your home. Its nice quality and I would reccomed to friends. This tree is beautiful and looks just like the image. Bought this tree after wanting one for two years as price was the issue but last year the top half of my tree stopped working so decided to go with this tree I have been blowaway.</p>

<p>Roof awnings overhangs peaks and windows are popular locations for hanging icicle lights and because the drops lay naturally they create a professional quality display either hanging on angles or across straight lines. Roof awnings overhangs peaks and windows are popular locations for hanging icicle lights and because the drops lay naturally they create a professional quality display either hanging on angles or across straight lines. Its easy to put up nice looking fake tree without lights on but then you turn it on its a light show thats fantastic. I didnt think it was pre lit so I ordered the 65 ft one instead. From beautiful forest scenes to on-trend grey tree wallpaper for walls find everything you need to bring your touch of the outdoors into your home.</p>

<p>I didnt think it was pre lit so I ordered the 65 ft one instead. Its nice quality and I would reccomed to friends. Classic and beautiful icicle lights are a popular choice for Christmas and holiday lighting. The only I didnt like was the way the company labeled the 75ft tree as warm lights unlit. You have to shape it at first like an other artificial tree.</p>

<p>Its nice quality and I would reccomed to friends. This tree is beautiful and looks just like the image. Classic and beautiful icicle lights are a popular choice for Christmas and holiday lighting. Bought this tree after wanting one for two years as price was the issue but last year the top half of my tree stopped working so decided to go with this tree I have been blowaway. The only I didnt like was the way the company labeled the 75ft tree as warm lights unlit.</p>
