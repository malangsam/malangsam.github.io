If someone has to dress up like Santa or you wont back a fund raise Then youre a fuck face If it has to be Christmas for you to be nice Youre a bastard If you think compassions just in fashion Youre a fucking nob If it has to be New Years for you to make a change for the better Youre a spineless fucking turd Youre a spineless fucking turd. And so happy Christmas.</p>
