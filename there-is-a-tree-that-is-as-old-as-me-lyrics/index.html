Birds singing in a sycamore tree Dream a little dream of me Say nighty night and kiss me Just hold me tight and tell me you miss me While Im alone and blue as can be Dream a little dream of me Stars fading but I linger on dear Still craving your kiss Im longing to linger till dawn dear Just saying this Sweet dreams till sunbeams find you. Then I awake and look around me At four grey walls that surround me And I realize. For theres a guard and theres a sad old padre.</p>

Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary Hair of gold and lips like cherries.</p>
