<p>There a lot to be learned so look around Just what makes that little old ant Think hell move that rubber tree plant Anyone knows an ant cant Move a rubber tree plant But hes got high hopes hes got high hopes Hes got high apple pie in the sky hopes So any time your gettin low Stead of lettin go Just remember that ant. I said to the riverside tree This is the song that my tree friend sang to me. Chorus There is a tree beyond the world In its ancient roots a song is curled Im the fool whose lifes been spent Between whats said and what is meant I didnt mean what went so wrong Some things I wish I didnt know Ive always lived inside my head And often utterly alone I will be a pillow for your head You can make me promises you cant keep And Ill believe each word youve said. The trouble with the Maples. Sing together And the tree was in the hole and the hole was in the ground.</p>
