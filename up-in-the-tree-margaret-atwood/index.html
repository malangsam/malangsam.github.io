<p>Margaret Atwoods classic picture book is a perfect integration of words and pictures. Long out of print Up in the Tree was first published in 1978. For example Up In The TreeMargaret Atwood if you order a compare contrast essay and you think Up In The TreeMargaret Atwood that few arguments are missing. Because it was considered too expensive and risky to publish a childrens book in Canada Atwood not only wrote and illustrated the book but hand-lettered the type. Two children rejoice in their home up in a tree free from parental guidance and earthbound concerns.</p>

<p>Its something about the crumpled sheets hanging over the edge like jungle foliage the terry slippers gaping their dark pink mouths for your feet the unseen breakfast some. Its the story of a small boy and girl who live happily in a tree until one day their ladder is taken away. You wake up filled with dread. Morning light sifts through the window there is birdsong you cant get out of bed. It is also classic Margaret Atwood and a wonderful gift for any lover of her words.</p>
