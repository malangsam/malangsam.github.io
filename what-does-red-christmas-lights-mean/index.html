<p>The color pink is the result of combining red and white together creating a fusion of love and purity. They focus on the giving and receiving of gifts instead of on our greatest Gift Jesus Who gave Himself to us at Christmas. In addition to an extra bulb you might have a red tipped bulb. In general red is often used. Also they express possible fatigue of you to give everything in your company and to work very hard.</p>
