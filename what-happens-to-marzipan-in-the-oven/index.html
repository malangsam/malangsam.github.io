<p>To flatten marzipan for cutting place it between two sheets of wax paper and roll it out with a pin. Using dark sugar demerara molasses and light or dark muscovado keeps the crumb of the cake moist and adds to depth of flavour. Sounds funny but it can happen and youd have soon know if it was fermentation. Preheat the oven to 300F and have two ungreased baking sheets ready. Freshly baked by the famous Marzipan Bakery in Jerusalem.</p>
