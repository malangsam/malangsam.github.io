<p>It includes lots of real marzipan as well as a few drops of almond extract to really bring out the flavour. Mascarpone Frosting made with mascarpone heavy cream confectioners sugar and almond and vanilla extracts is a lusciously smooth creamy frosting. Christoffer Hruskovas Dark chocolate floedebolle is a traditional Danish sweet using marzipan meringue and chocolate while Victoria Glass uses marzipan to make her delicious Swedish Princess cupcakes and Sally Abe uses it in her classic Battenberg. If you want to ice the cake you should put the traditional coat of almond icing marzipan on it a week before you want to do so. Keep processing until a thick smooth paste forms.</p>
