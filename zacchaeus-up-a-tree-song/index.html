<p>Zacchaeus was a wee little man A wee little man was he. She sent for Barak and told him that the Lord said to take 10000 men to fight Sisera and they would win. Any children who have sung the Sunday School song Zacchaeus will be able to tell you Zacchaeus distinguishing characteristichis short stature. When I think of the sycamore tree I think of the old song we sang in Sunday school about Zacchaeus. He climbed up in a sycamore tree for the Lord he wanted to see. I didnt really think about it as a great firewood.</p>
